### Configuration Structure
All settings are defined in strongly-typed models located in `Models/ConfigurationModels.cs`:
- **RipSettings**: MakeMKV configuration, output paths, size filtering (MinSizeGB/MaxSizeGB), MinTrackLength filtering, media processing options
- **OmdbSettings**: OMDB API credentials and endpoints  
- **FileTransferSettings**: Remote file transfer configuration
- **PostRipSettings**: Post-processing cleanup options including DeleteFilesSmallerThan setting
- **Logging**: File and console logging configuration with rotation and size limits

User secrets are used in DEBUG mode for sensitive configuration like API keys (User Secrets ID: `03359cd6-bc97-47ea-95e3-ed36c00c2be0`). All configuration classes include proper validation and null-checking.

### TV Series Intelligence
The application has sophisticated logic for handling multi-disc TV series:
- Parses disc names to extract series/season/disc information
- Maintains episode numbering state across multiple discs
- Handles various disc naming patterns (e.g., `Series_S8_D1_BD`)
- Stores persistent state in `MediaStateManager` for session continuity

### Pattern Learning System (NEW)
The application includes machine learning capabilities for TV series processing with the `UserConfirmed` track sorting strategy:

**Core Components:**
- **PatternLearningService**: Records and analyzes user episode confirmation choices
- **TrackSelectionPattern**: Data model for storing user selection history
- **EpisodeTrackPattern**: Learned patterns with confidence scores
- **TrackToEpisodeMapping**: Individual track-to-episode associations

**How It Works:**
1. **Recording Phase**: When users confirm or modify episode suggestions, the system records:
   - Track position and episode number selected
   - Whether the user accepted or changed the suggestion
   - Confidence scores based on user behavior
2. **Learning Phase**: After processing each disc, patterns are analyzed and stored:
   - Track position patterns within the same series and season
   - Confidence scores updated based on user acceptance/rejection
   - Only applies to series using `TrackSortingStrategy.UserConfirmed`
3. **Suggestion Phase**: For subsequent discs in the same series/season:
   - Suggests episode numbers based on learned patterns
   - Only provides suggestions above minimum confidence threshold (0.7)
   - Falls back to standard numbering if confidence is low

**Pattern Matching Strategy:**
- Patterns are series-specific and season-specific only
- Does not rely on disc name patterns (since UserConfirmed is about user choices, not disc structure)
- Confidence increases when users accept suggestions, decreases when they modify them
- Requires minimum 2 samples to establish reliable patterns

### Cross-Platform Considerations
- **DriveWatcher.cs**: Windows-specific implementation using WinMM API
- **DriveWatcher_wsl.cs**: Alternative for WSL environments
- Conditional compilation with `#if !WSL` directives
- Native library `libcdrom.so` for Linux CD/DVD access

## Key Workflows

### Main Processing Pipeline
1. Drive monitoring detects inserted disc
2. **Early media type prediction** based on disc name patterns
3. MakeMKV scans disc for titles
4. **Pre-identification** with user confirmation (if needed)
5. **Consolidated TV series configuration** (for new series)
6. **Pattern learning suggestions** (for UserConfirmed sorting strategy)
7. Size-based filtering with series-specific or global settings
8. **Pre-rip confirmation summary** showing all settings
9. Ripping to temporary location
10. **File discovery** and verification of ripped content
11. OMDB API lookup for episode details (if not pre-identified)
12. Plex-compatible file/folder naming
13. File organization or remote transfer
14. **Pattern learning updates** based on user selections
15. Drive ejection when complete

### User Interaction Workflows

#### Startup Mode Selection
Users can choose between:
- **Automatic Mode**: Minimal interaction, uses saved profiles
- **Manual Mode**: Full control over track selection and naming
- **Configure TV Series Profiles**: Pre-configure series settings

#### TV Series Profile Configuration (NEW)
When a new TV series is detected, all settings are configured upfront:
1. **Episode Size Range**: Custom min/max GB for filtering
2. **Track Sorting**: By MakeMKV order or MPLS filename
3. **Double Episode Handling**: Auto-detect, always single, or always double
4. **Starting Position**: Season and episode numbers if unclear
5. **Auto-increment Mode**: For multi-disc series handling

These profiles are saved and reused for future discs from the same series.

#### Pre-Rip Confirmation (NEW)
Before ripping begins, users see a summary of:
- Media title and type
- Number of tracks to rip
- Size filtering settings
- TV series-specific settings (sorting, episode handling)
- List of selected tracks

Users can proceed, modify settings, or skip the disc.

### File Organization Patterns
- **Movies**: `Movies/{Title} ({Year})/{Title} ({Year}).mkv`
- **TV Series**: `TV Shows/{Series}/Season {##}/{Series} - S##E## - {Episode Title}.mkv`

### Media Type Prediction (NEW)
The system analyzes disc names to predict media type:
- **TV Series Patterns**: S##D##, Season_#_Disc_#, Series names
- **Movie Patterns**: Year (19xx/20xx), quality indicators (1080p, BluRay)

This helps streamline the identification process by suggesting the likely media type.

## External Dependencies

### Required
- **MakeMKV**: Must be installed and licensed for disc ripping functionality
- **OMDB API Key**: Required for movie/TV series metadata (set in OmdbSettings.ApiKey)

### Runtime Environment
- Windows OS (for drive monitoring) or WSL
- Network access for OMDB API calls and optional file transfers
- CD/DVD/Blu-ray drive for disc detection

## Development Notes

### Clean Architecture Benefits
The refactored codebase now follows clean architecture principles:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each service has a single responsibility
